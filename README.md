<h1>CyberMACS Program Conference RDBMS using PostgreSQL</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
CyberMACS is an Erasmus MUNDUS Joint Master's Degree (EMJM) programme in Applied Cybersecurity offered by a Consortium of three universities in TÃ¼rkiye, Germany, and North Macedonia. The CyberMACS Consortium is organizing the International Applied Cybersecurity Conference (IACyC 2025) to be held in Ohrid, North Macedonia, in November. The event aims to bring together academics, graduate students, industry professionals, and representatives from public institutions to discuss applied challenges and solutions in cybersecurity. The conference is jointly coordinated by multiple universities and includes hybrid participation, both on-site and online.
To effectively manage the event, the organizing committee is seeking a database-driven system that will serve as the backbone for tracking registrations, paper submissions, session planning, speaker arrangements, sponsorships, and communications with stakeholders.
