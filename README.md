<h1>CyberMACS Program Conference RDBMS using PostgreSQL</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
CyberMACS is an Erasmus MUNDUS Joint Master's Degree (EMJM) programme in Applied Cybersecurity offered by a Consortium of three universities in TÃ¼rkiye, Germany, and North Macedonia. The CyberMACS Consortium is organizing the International Applied Cybersecurity Conference (IACyC 2025) to be held in Ohrid, North Macedonia, in November. The event aims to bring together academics, graduate students, industry professionals, and representatives from public institutions to discuss applied challenges and solutions in cybersecurity. The conference is jointly coordinated by multiple universities and includes hybrid participation, both on-site and online.
To effectively manage the event, the organizing committee is seeking a database-driven system that will serve as the backbone for tracking registrations, paper submissions, session planning, speaker arrangements, sponsorships, and communications with stakeholders.

<h2>Course Outcomes & Skills</h2>
This course emphasized the theory and practice of database system design, data modeling, and query optimization.  
Through both academic and applied projects, the following key skills and competencies were developed:

- <b>End-to-End Database Design:</b> Designed complex relational database systems using ER modeling and normalization to ensure scalability, consistency, and data integrity.  
- <b>Advanced SQL Programming:</b> Authored and optimized SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, triggers, stored procedures, and transactions to support dynamic user operations.  
- <b>Database Performance Optimization:</b> Applied indexing, query tuning, and schema refinement for faster retrieval and efficient storage management.  
- <b>System Architecture Knowledge:</b> Understood how RDBMS manage concurrency, transactions, and recovery mechanisms in multi-user environments.  
- <b>Real-World Application:</b> Implemented a fully functional RDBMS prototype for conference management integrating multiple data relationships and dependencies.  
- <b>Analytical & Problem-Solving:</b> Translated business requirements into structured data models and optimized logical-physical design alignment.  

ðŸ’¡ *This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL, data modeling, and analytical thinkingâ€”core skills for database administration, backend development, and data engineering roles.*
